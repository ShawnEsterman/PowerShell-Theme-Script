# PowerShell Theme Script
This script was written to set the PowerShell ISE theme at login. When I customized my own theme using the built in editor I was noticing changes when I reopened PowerShell. My solution was to create a script that ran in my PowerShell profile. 

Tried to document it well so you could use my method and change the color scheme to something of your choice. I choose the [Inconsolata-DZ](http://nodnod.net/2009/feb/12/adding-straight-single-and-double-quotes-inconsola/) font and choose colors from [FlatUiColors.co](http://flatuicolors.co/).
